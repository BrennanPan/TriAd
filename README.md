TriAd is a framework designed to convert phone videos into 3D models and then into VR simulations viewable with an Oculus device. Our goal was to create an innovative tool for businesses to enhance their advertising by offering immersive VR experiences. The program captures and processes video data, transforming it into interactive 3D environments for marketing and promotional purposes.
